### Automated Income Generation
- **Low-Input Revenue**: Automated product sourcing reduces manual work while maintaining quality standards
- **Ethical Affiliate Marketing**: Partnerships only with companies that meet our quality and ethical standards
- **Sustainable Model**: Focus on long-term user trust and repeat engagement over short-term gains

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive, modern design
- **Content**: Rich text editing with Tiptap for detailed herb/supplement descriptions

### Backend & Database
- **API Routes**: Next.js API routes for dynamic content and product management
- **Database**: Neon Postgres with Prisma ORM
- **Deployment**: Vercel for seamless CI/CD

### Content Management
- **Admin Interface**: Comprehensive content management system
- **Data Import/Export**: Automated systems for bulk content updates
- **Quality Control**: Admin-curated quality criteria for product selection

## üåä THE DOMINO RALLY CASCADE SYSTEM

### **The Revolutionary Content Network**

TheNerveVine features a sophisticated **cascade automation system** where one product approval creates a ripple effect across the entire content network. This is the heart of our automated affiliate marketplace.

### **üéØ Quality ‚Üî Revenue Spectrum Control**

Admins can adjust the system from "Quality over Revenue" to "Revenue at All Costs" using dynamic scoring weights:

```typescript
// Quality-focused (ethical sweet spot)
const scoringWeights = {
  qualityScore: 0.7,        // Prioritize product quality
  commissionRate: 0.2,      // Secondary consideration
  userReviews: 0.1         // User satisfaction
};

// Revenue-focused (maximum profit)
const scoringWeights = {
  qualityScore: 0.2,        // Minimum quality threshold
  commissionRate: 0.7,      // Maximize commissions
  availability: 0.1         // Stock considerations
};
```

### **üîÑ The Cascade Flow**

    F --> I["Update /symptoms/cognitive-decline"]
    G --> J["Live Product Sections Updated"]
    H --> J
    I --> J
    J --> K["Entire Network Refreshed"]
```

### **üìä Content Hierarchy & Product Flow**

#### **For Each Herb:**
- **Traditional Formulations**: Tinctures, teas, powders
- **Phytoceuticals**: Standardized extracts, capsules
- **Quality Specifications**: Admin-defined criteria per formulation type

#### **For Each Symptom:**
- **Top 1-2 Recommended Herbs**: Primary therapeutic focus
- **Supporting Supplements**: Vitamins, minerals, oils (non-herbal)
- **Dynamic Product Population**: Automatically inherits from approved herb/supplement products

### **‚ö° The Ripple Effect in Action**

**Phase 1: Product Approval & Herb/Supplement Population**
When an admin approves products, they first populate their respective herb/supplement pages:
- **Ginkgo tincture & standardized extract** ‚Üí populate `/herbs/ginkgo-biloba` (Traditional & Modern formulations)
- **Lion's Mane double-fermented tincture & extract** ‚Üí populate `/herbs/lions-mane` 
- **L-tyrosine high-strength vegi gelcaps** ‚Üí populate `/supplements/l-tyrosine`

**Phase 2: Indication Assignment & Symptom Cascade**
When these herbs/supplements are assigned "Poor Memory" indication:
- All approved products from Ginkgo, Lion's Mane, and L-tyrosine cascade to `/symptoms/poor-memory`
- Evidence scores control product priority and order on symptom pages
- Prevents overpopulation by limiting products per symptom based on evidence scores

**Evidence Scoring System:**
- Evidence scores stored on relationship tables (HerbIndication, SupplementIndication)
- Same herb can have different evidence scores for different indications
- Example: Ginkgo + Memory (evidence: 90), Ginkgo + Anxiety (evidence: 60)
- Controls product priority and visibility on symptom pages

## üîÑ Automated Product Sourcing System

### API Integration Framework
- **Merchant APIs**: Automated integration with major supplement and wellness retailers
- **Quality Filtering**: Admin-defined criteria automatically filter products
- **Real-Time Updates**: Product availability and pricing updated automatically
- **Affiliate Link Generation**: Automated creation of tracked affiliate links

### Quality Criteria System
- **Ingredient Standards**: Products must meet specified ingredient quality requirements
- **Manufacturing Standards**: GMP compliance, third-party testing, etc.
- **Brand Reputation**: Historical performance and user satisfaction metrics
- **Price-Performance Ratio**: Value assessment relative to quality
- **Availability**: Stock levels and shipping reliability

### Admin Curation Process
1. **Criteria Definition**: Admins set quality thresholds and requirements
2. **Automated Filtering**: APIs automatically filter products based on criteria
3. **Manual Review**: Final approval of automated selections
4. **CASCADE ACTIVATION**: Approved products ripple through the entire network
5. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor conversion rates and user satisfaction
