# Workflows

## Herb/Supp Entry Creation

For each of the 110+ substances on the site, follow this 6-step workflow:

### 1. SciSpace Research Overview
- Find top 10 research papers for the substance
- Generate overview document based on these papers
- This provides the scientific foundation for the substance

### 2. ChatGPT Processing
- Use consistent prompt to format the overview into main description
- Ensures consistent tone/style across all substances
- Standardizes the content format for detail pages

### 3. Deep Research (Full Page)
- Conduct meta-analysis of the research
- Create "Dive Deeper" section with comprehensive analysis
- This provides detailed, research-backed content for the full page

### 4. Quality Specifications
- Define purity standards, testing requirements, sourcing criteria
- Set thresholds for what makes a "quality" product
- This enables the cascade system's quality filtering

### 5. Evidence Scoring
- Apply Traditional (1-5) and Research (1-5) scores
- Calculate total scores (1.5-7.5) using the weighted formula
- This drives the cascade system's product selection logic

### 6. Indication Mapping
- Link substance to relevant symptoms/variants
- Apply the evidence scores to each indication
- This creates the network map for the cascade system

**Note:** This workflow applies to each of the 110+ substances currently in the database. Each substance requires significant research time, making this a months-long undertaking that will result in a comprehensive, research-backed herbal medicine database.
