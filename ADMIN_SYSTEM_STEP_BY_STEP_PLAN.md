# Step-by-Step Plan: Building the Full Admin System

This plan outlines the key steps to transform your admin area from a UI prototype into a robust, full-stack system. Each step is actionable and business-focused, designed for iterative improvement.

---

## 1. **Persist Quality Specifications**
- **Goal:** Store quality specs (for each herb/product type) in the database, not just in browser memory.
- **Actions:**
  - Design a `QualitySpecification` model in your database (Prisma schema).
  - Build backend API routes for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on quality specs.
  - Update the admin UI to load/save specs via the API.

---

## 2. **Admin Authentication**
- **Goal:** Restrict admin area access to authorized users only.
- **Actions:**
  - Implement a simple password-based login (can be upgraded later).
  - Protect all admin routes/pages with authentication middleware.

---

## 3. **Product Curation & Approval**
- **Goal:** Allow admin to review, approve, and link products (from affiliate APIs) to herbs, supplements, and symptoms.
- **Actions:**
  - Design and implement the `Product` and `AdminProductSelection` models in the database.
  - Build admin UI for browsing, filtering, and approving products.
  - Store admin approvals and notes in the database.

---

## 4. **Connect Admin UI to Backend**
- **Goal:** Make all admin actions persistent and robust.
- **Actions:**
  - Build or update API routes for all admin operations (quality specs, product curation, settings).
  - Refactor admin UI to use these APIs for all data changes.

---

## 5. **Central Admin Dashboard**
- **Goal:** Provide a single hub for all admin tasks and site management.
- **Actions:**
  - Design a dashboard page summarizing key data (pending approvals, recent changes, etc.).
  - Add navigation to all admin features (quality specs, product curation, settings, blog uploads).

---

## 6. **Iterate and Refine**
- **Goal:** Improve workflows, add analytics, and respond to real admin needs.
- **Actions:**
  - Gather feedback from real admin use.
  - Add features like search, bulk actions, analytics, and notifications as needed.

---

## 7. **(Optional) User Management & Advanced Features**
- **Goal:** Prepare for future growth (user accounts, persistent carts, advanced permissions).
- **Actions:**
  - Add user models and authentication upgrades as needed.
  - Expand admin features based on business needs.
